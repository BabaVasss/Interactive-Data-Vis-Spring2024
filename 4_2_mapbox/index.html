    <h4> Introduction | Abstract | Purpose</h4>
    <p>
      The purpose of this website is to help tourists in NYC locate the MoMA and understand the types of art metrics they might witness while attending. In the map below, the trainstations throughout the boroughs are highlighted red because NYC trains are the most "reliable" source of transportation.

      <h5> Male and Female Artists</h5>
 <br>
      <p>The graph below represents artist contribution by gender at the MoMA</p>
      <div id="container"></div>
 <br>
      <p>The "male and female" dataset was created by isolating the gender category from the MoMA distributions dataset into a discrete dataframe.In this new dataframe I cleaned the data by removing cells that were not indicators of either male or female and aggreated the remaining cells that were indicators by count to represent total male and total female art work contribution represented by MoMA distributions</p>
